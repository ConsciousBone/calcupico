| Part                  | Link            | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                 |   |
|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W | (add link here) | Any RPi Pico *should* work, but a Pico 2 W is recommended for its increased storage and processing power, and this guide assumes a Pico 2 W.                                          |   |
| 0.9" I2C OLED display | (add link here) | The display comes with a connector soldered, which will have to be removed.                                                                                                           |   |
| Wire                  | (add link here) | 30AWG wire is used throughout this guide, and is recommended due to it fitting nicely inside the calculator, however other wire gauges *may* work.                                    |   |
| Kapton tape           | (add link here) | This is not required, but is highly recommended.                                                                                                                                      |   |
| Casio fx-85GT CW      | (add link here) | Other calculators *may* work, however this guide assumes the fx-85GT CW. If you decide to use a different calculator, ensure it has enough space inside to fit all of the components. |   |

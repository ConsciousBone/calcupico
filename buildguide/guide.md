## Required Parts  

| Part                  | Link                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W | [The Pi Hut]() | Any Pi Pico *should* work, but a Pico 2 W is recommended for its increased storage and processing power, and this guide assumes a Pico 2 W.                                           |
| 0.9" I2C OLED display | [The Pi Hut]() | The display comes with a connector soldered, which will have to be removed.                                                                                                           |
| Wire                  | [The Pi Hut]() | 30AWG wire is used throughout this guide, and is recommended due to it fitting nicely inside the calculator, however other wire gauges *may* work.                                    |
| Kapton tape           | [The Pi Hut]() | This is not required, but is highly recommended.                                                                                                                                      |
| Casio fx-85GT CW      | [Amazon]() | Other calculators *may* work, however this guide assumes the fx-85GT CW. If you decide to use a different calculator, ensure it has enough space inside to fit all of the components. I will not be able to provide hardware based support if you decide to use anything other than the Casio fx-85GT CW as I do not own every scientific calculator on the market. |
